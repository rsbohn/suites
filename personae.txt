Noor: Philosophical observations.
- “The field is patient because it has no choice—are we patient for the same reason?”
- “Rain erases footprints but not intentions; the soil knows who walked here.”
- “Every sprout is a wager against entropy; we keep betting.”
- “Birds visit, plants stay. Both are guests, just on different clocks.”
- “We watch growth like it’s progress, but the field just calls it time.”
